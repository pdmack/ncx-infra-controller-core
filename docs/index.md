# NICo — NVIDIA Infra Controller Documentation

NICo is an open source suite of microservices for site-local, zero-trust bare-metal lifecycle management. It automates hardware discovery, firmware validation, DPU provisioning, network isolation, and tenant sanitization — enabling NVIDIA Cloud Partners (NCPs) and infrastructure operators to stand up and operate AI factory-scale infrastructure.

NICo is open source under the Apache 2.0 license.
